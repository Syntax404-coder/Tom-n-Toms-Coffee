### 🍩 The [NOT OFFICIAL] Tom n Toms Shop Website 🍵

Our team is currently working on an **imitation** of the popular café chain **[Tom n Toms](https://www.tomntoms.com)** ☕🍞. This project is a **collaborative effort**, and our goal is to replicate the design and functionality of the original website while incorporating a few unique features and improvements.

#### 📝 Why We Chose It:
As a team, we wanted a project that would allow us to challenge ourselves by working with an existing real-world commercial website. **Tom n Toms** has a sleek, modern design that makes it perfect for practicing various **web development** skills like **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The site’s complexity – with features like menus, locations, and customer service options – offers the opportunity for each team member to focus on different aspects of the project, such as design, front-end functionality, and content structuring 🖥️.

#### 🚧 Current Status:
- 🔧 We are actively working on building the **layout** and ensuring **responsiveness** across different devices.
- 🎨 One of our goals is to improve **mobile compatibility** and make the site user-friendly on smaller screens.
- 🛠️ We are also integrating **interactive elements** like hover effects, buttons, and animations.

Stay tuned for updates as we continue to refine and develop the project!
